<h7>Linux / Unix</h7>

<ul><p>I can help you with your <a href="http://www.mariusv.com/tag/linux/">Linux & Unix</a> needs: I've worked with Unix and (more recently) Linux systems for 14 years so have the experience to address your needs. I do systems administration, troubleshooting, programming and networking. I'm familiar with many flavours of <a href="http://www.mariusv.com/tag/linux/">Unix and Linux </a>including <a href="http://www.mariusv.com/tag/solaris/">Solaris</a>, <a href="http://www.mariusv.com/tag/centos/">Red Hat / CentOS, SuSE</a>, <a href="http://www.mariusv.com/tag/debian/">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.mariusv.com/tag/ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://www.mariusv.com/tag/freebsd/">OpenBSD, FreeBSD</a>. I typically work remotely over SSH to provide you with solutions, but can also work on-site.</ul></p>

<h7>Systems Administration (<a href="http://www.rentsysadmin.com">Sysadmin</a>)</h7>

<ul><p>I work regularly with large and small systems, both standalone and in more complex setups (clusters, server farms etc.); I also have the networking knowledge to know how these interact.</ul></p>

<h7>"Rent a Sysadmin"</h7>

<ul><p>For business continuity to cover staff absences or shortages I can provide on- or off-site sysadmin services: My normal consulting skills mean I'm up and running in an organisation very fast.</ul></p>

<h7>Troubleshooting</h7>

<ul><p>I work with a broad range of operating systems and packages, so I have a good sense of where to look when things go wrong. I also know when I'm out of my depth and I'm not afraid to say so - I'll be happy to explore your needs and say if I can help.</ul></p>

<h7>Networks</h7>

<ul><p>I have experience with complex network setups including firewalls, routers & switches. I also know my way around wireless networks, whether this be setting them up or troubleshooting them.

I can provide assistance with network services, such as DNS, NFS, DHCP etc.

If you need to optimise your network or its applications, I can help. I am also familiar with scaling technologies - load balancing, server farms, clusters, NASes and the like.</ul></p>

<h7>Programming</h7>

<ul><p>I can offer programming skills in C and shell scripting languages (Bourne Shell, Bash, Perl, Python, C shell). Whether you wish to fix, enhance or modify an existing program, please take the opportunity to discuss your requirements with me.</ul></p>
