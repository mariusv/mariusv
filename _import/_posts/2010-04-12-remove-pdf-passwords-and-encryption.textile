Have you ever gotten a pdf with one of those annoying passwords? A while back I bought an e-book and it came with a password. Its really annoying especially if I want to read it on a mobile device. Anyway if you are annoyed as much as I am fear no more.

Install qpdf
<pre>aptitude install qpdf</pre>

Decrypt your pdf

<pre>qpdf --password=password --decrypt input.pdf output.pdf</pre>
