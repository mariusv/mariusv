No money / time for a fulltime system administrator ?
Of maybe you need extra help besides your current system administration ?
Rent a SysAdmin for a parttime price.One fixed price a month, every day administration on your servers / workstations.
-changes will be made outside office hours.
-support outside office hours.
-reports.
-All software always up-to-date.

In other words, no worries anymore about your servers / workstations.

Of course I will also manage other networking devices and everything related to for example the internet.
And I can also expand your network with whatever you want, just like you have hired your own system administrator.
