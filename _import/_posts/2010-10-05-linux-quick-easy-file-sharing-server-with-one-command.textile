*Don’t install a server, just issue one command!*

So, you want to share a file with a friend. It could be a document, a song, a directory of photos, anything.

Do you want to install and set up a server? NO!

Do you want to go to a directory and issue one command? YES!

*Open your terminal and cd to the directory where you want to share the file(s) from:*

    @cd /home/YOUR_USER/some_folder@

*Now start the Python Simple HTTP Server:*

    @python -m SimpleHTTPServer@

*That’s it! Open your browser and go to this url:*

    @http://localhost:8000 or http://127.0.0.1:8000@

Now you will see the files that you want to share. All you need to do is send a message to your friend with your IP address and port :8000 and he/she can download anything from your /shared directory.

You can get your external IP address by going to:

    <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org">What Is My IP</a>

Once you have finished, go back to your terminal and hit Ctrl+C and the server will stop.
