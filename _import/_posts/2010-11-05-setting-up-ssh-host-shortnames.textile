Here’s an example setup to create SSH host shortnames. On your local computer, add the following to _~/.ssh/config_ :

<pre lang="bash">Host server1
HostName server1.internet.com
User marius

Host server2
HostName server2.internet.com
User marius

Host *
User marius</pre>


p. Now with this file saved, you can ssh into _server2.hostname.tld_ with just the following command:



@ssh server2@

p. This will save you having to type out:



@ssh marius@server2.hostname.tld@

p. And if you have _public key authentication_ setup, it makes the process even smoother. Adding the wildcard host record at the bottom allows you to specify a default username to use for other servers to the ones you’ve not specified above.
