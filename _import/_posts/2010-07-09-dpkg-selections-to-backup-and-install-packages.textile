Sometimes you want to be able to install packages on another machine without the hassle of a long apt-get install command or having to write down every single package you've installed.

Luckily Debian has the wonderful dpkg which has 2 methods for generating a list of installed packages and another for importing a list.

*Generating a list of installed packages*

<pre>sudo dpkg --get-selections > selections</pre>

This will generate a file called selections which will contain something like:

<pre>... snip ...
adduser install
apache2 install
apache2-mpm-prefork install
apache2-utils install
apache2.2-bin install
apache2.2-common install
apt install
... snip...</pre>

This is just a simple, plain text file so can be copied between servers.

*Installing packages from an exported list:*

This is almost just as easy, first we need to actually set the list of selected packages

<pre>dpkg --get-selections < selections</pre>

Then we need to actually do an update and install:

<pre>apt-get update && sudo apt-get -u dselect-upgrade</pre>

This last command will update your apt cache and then install all of the selected packages.

Please note that version numbers are *NOT* remembered so you will install the latest version of each package.
