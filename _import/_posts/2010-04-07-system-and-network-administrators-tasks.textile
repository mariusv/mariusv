I have been thinking about this, and came up with my own list of System/Network Admin truths. I struggled with the word truths, and instead of refering to my list as System and Network Admin truths, I see this list as a list of tasks or responsibilities that if maintained on a daily basis, will help System and Network Administrators to reduce downtime and ensure that they are better prepared to deal with issues when they occur.

*Top 10 System and Network Administrator Tasks*

1. *Backups are a requirement and are crucial to your success*
â€¢ Eventually all hardware will fail, so be prepared
â€¢ You need to create a backup strategy and backup all application data

2. *Monitoring Tools*
â€¢ Monitoring tools are different in all companies, however you need to invest in them and make them a requirement.
â€¢ The Gartner Group estimates that system/network managers can manage about 30 servers per admin, we all know that this number varies depending on experience and maturity of the technology. Monitoring tools help this tremendously.
â€¢ Monitor all applications, servers, and network connectivity
â€¢ Establish performance baselines to help troubleshoot performance related problems.

3. *Maintain Service Contracts with all vendors*
â€¢ Maintenance contracts should be required for all production environments. That includes contracts for both hardware support and software support.

4. *Maintain Version Control*
â€¢ Version control is essential when troubleshooting issues. Vendors often fall back on the old line â€œWe fixed that in the latest release, please upgrade to the latest releaseâ€, so STAY CURRENT on all software products.

5. *Consistent Hardware Builds and Software Installations*
â€¢ Create a strategy that includes redundancy in all hardware builds
â€¢ Consistency helps with maintenance and troubleshooting.
â€¢ Document your builds and installations

6. *Documentation*
â€¢ Develop some standards surrounding documentation
â€¢ Organize all of your documents and store them in a central place that can be accessed by all admins.
â€¢ Document the backup process, document your monitoring process, document your vendors contact information, document your builds and installations, in the end, you will be glad that you did.

7. *Communication*
â€¢ Communication comes in many forms, memos, email, IM, voice mail, process and build documentation are all forms of communication.
â€¢ Be consistent with your communication, and always re-read your emails before sending.
â€¢ When there is a problem at 2:00am and you get paged, send a note to the group after resolving the issue, the little notes after problem resolutions go along way to teamwork and documentation.

8. *Teamwork*
â€¢ Teamwork is a subject that will not fit into four or five bullets, however it is critical to all IT operations.
â€¢ Teamwork is about coming together, sharing together, working together, and succeeding together, especially in adversity.
â€¢ Great teams and handle and work through the most difficult situations.

9. *Training and Schooling*
â€¢ Go back to school, work toward a degree, this will extend your career
â€¢ If you already completed a degree program or if you are not interested in an undergraduate or graduate degree, then look into Technical Certificates.
â€¢ If you are not interested in either a degree or certificate then do your best to stay current with Technology changes.

10. *Stay Current with Technology*
â€¢ A motivated individual looking to learn and grow, has many resources available on the Internet,
â€¢ Read the Trade Rags, visit the Tech Web sites, Read Blogs, listen to podcasts, go to conferences.
