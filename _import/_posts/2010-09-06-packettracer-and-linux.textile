p. There is a bug with PacketTracer which seems relatively minor but can cause a lot of frustration to users.


p. *Take me for example:* The first day in class we were given a review packet tracer file to work on. I forgot to save and when I finally remembered it bit me in the but! I went to save my work and PacketTracer crashed! I lost everything.


p. *Issue:* PacketTracer 5.2.1 crashes / segfaults on linux when saving files.


p. *Reason:* PacketTracer 5.2.1&nbsp; is built against Qt 4.4.3.&nbsp; However, it is using the system version of Qt which is likely newer. In my case, I’m using Qt 4.5.3. Many other distributions also use 4.5.3. It appears that there has been a code change between Qt 4.4.3 and 4.4.5; therefore, making 4.4.5 incompatible with PT 5.2.1.



p. *Solution:* Have&nbsp;PacketTracer use the qt libs that it ships with.

This&nbsp; can be accomplished with the use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH and a shell script.



<pre lang="bash">#!/bin/sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/pt/lib"
/opt/pt/bin/PacketTracer5</pre>

Adjust the paths as necessary, save the file, and make it executable.
PT might not look as nice and pretty, but it won’t crash!
