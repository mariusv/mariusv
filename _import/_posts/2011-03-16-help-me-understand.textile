“_Help me understand…_” – I HATE that phrase. It’s a plea for someone else to be responsible for your ability to comprehend. That’s not my problem to solve.

Try “_explain to me_” instead. I can explain something all day long. Multiple ways. I can teach you concepts. I can point you to reference material. I can help you in those ways but if you can’t understand the concept that’s ultimately *YOUR* problem to figure out.
