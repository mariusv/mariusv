<a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/">Rackspace Cloud</a>, or <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, which is best? This is just a quick performance comparison using <a href="http://sysbench.sourceforge.net/">SysBench</a>. The following products where tested.

p. Servers where running Ubuntu 9.10 i386, tests where performed on two different occasions, average scores where used. Hereâ€™s the results, less is good.

p. The following commands where used to do the benching, interesting values was the total time to run the test.



<pre>sysbench --num-threads=4 --test=cpu run
sysbench --num-threads=4 --test=memory run
sysbench --num-threads=4 --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw prepare
sysbench --num-threads=4 --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw run</pre>

*Conclusion*

According to SysBench, Rackspace Cloud is much faster then EC2 in general, and cheaper as well. EC2 however comes with more memory and disk.
