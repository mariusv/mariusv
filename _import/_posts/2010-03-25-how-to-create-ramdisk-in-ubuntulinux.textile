I hope many of you will agree that sometimes itâ€™s really good idea to have some small amount of RAM mounted as a filesystem. It may be necessary when running some bash or perl script that handles, say, thousands of small files so itâ€™s much more effective not to waste computer resources on reading/writing data on hard disk but keep those files directly in memory. This idea is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_disk">Virtual RAM Drive</a> or *ramdisk* and can be setup in *Ubuntu* or almost any other *Linux* distribution using the following commands under root (to become root in Ubuntu use @"*sudo -s*@â€œ):



<pre># *mkdir /tmp/ramdisk; chmod 777 /tmp/ramdisk*

# *mount -t tmpfs -o size=256M tmpfs /tmp/ramdisk/*</pre>
p. where 256M is amount of RAM you wish to allocate for ramdisk. Itâ€™s clear that this value should be *less than amount of free memory* (use â€œ@free -m@â€œ). BTW, if you specify too many MBs for ramdisk Linux will try to allocate it from RAM and then from swap so resulting performance would be very poor.
