How to find those files that have different names but exactly the same content?

You could install the good <a href="http://packages.debian.org/etch/fdupes">fdupes</a> or you could just reinvent the wheel with bash, md5sum and awk:
<pre lang="bash">find path/ -type f | xargs md5sum | awk '{
	sub("[^/]*/","",$2);
	if (cache[$1])
		print "Found: "cache[$1],$2;
	else
		cache[$1]=$2
}'</pre>
_path_ is where you want to search for duplicates. You can limit the search with the *find* maxdepth option.
