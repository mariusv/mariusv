I wanted to know what IP addresses were hitting my website. I’d done this before and it only took a moment or two to recreate the following commands. Still, here it is for future reference:

@grep -v "wp-content" access.log|grep -v wp-includes|cut -f 1 -d " "|sort|uniq -c|sort -nr|less@

p. This code:


<ul>
<li> Excludes “wp-content” and “wp-includes” requests.</li>
<li> Uses “cut” to cut out the IP address.</li>
<li> Sorts the list of IP addresses.</li>

<li> Uses “uniq” to count the occurrence of each IP.</li>
<li> And finally reverse sorts the list again, by number of occurrences, with the largest number at the top.</li>
</ul>
p. You’ll probably find Google and Yahoo! bots near the top of the list, but I also found the “Jyxobot/1″ bot was quite busy today.
