It's 2010. We have cars that park themselves, my cell phone can do more than my first computer, America have a black president with a funny name. What does all that add up to? We live in the future. Yet still, after all this progress, there are some people that haven't learned to include an error message in a ticket.
Users, please understand this. Yes, we IT people are amazing. We can clear unclearable printer jam. We know a dieing hard drive just from the sound of it. We even know how to install and use iTunes. It may look to you like we are wizards, technomancers. We are not. There's no magic in this. We just know what to look at. If there's an error message, that's usually a good place to start.
