Here is a little script I made to quickly and easily create users and databases for MySQL. I only use this for development, for actual deployed applications you would probably want to be more specific about the privileges given:

<pre lang="bash">#!/bin/bash
 
EXPECTED_ARGS=3
E_BADARGS=65
MYSQL=`which mysql`
 
Q1="CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $1;"
Q2="GRANT ALL ON *.* TO '$2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$3';"
Q3="FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
SQL="${Q1}${Q2}${Q3}"
 
if [ $# -ne $EXPECTED_ARGS ]
then
  echo "Usage: $0 dbname dbuser dbpass"
  exit $E_BADARGS
fi
 
$MYSQL -uroot -p -e "$SQL"</pre>

To use it, just run:

<pre lang="bash">./createudb testdb testuser secretpass</pre>

That command would create a database named _testdb_, and user _testuser_ with the password of _secretpass_.
