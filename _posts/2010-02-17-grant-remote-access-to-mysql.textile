Here is a small tutorial if you want to grant remote access to a DB on your server.

First login trough SSH on your server and get access to you mysql



<pre lang="mysql">$mysqladmin -u XXX password  XXX</pre>

Note: that db_user and db_passwd are your database username and database password


<pre lang="mysql">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_base.* TO db_user @â€™%â€™ IDENTIFIED BY â€˜db_passwdâ€™;</pre>

You can also grant accesss to a specific IP adress

<pre lang="mysql">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON failserv_example.* TO failserver@â€™XX.XX.XX.XXâ€™ IDENTIFIED BY â€˜db_passwdâ€™;

    (where X is your own remote IP)</pre>

After that to activate your setting type

<pre>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>

And exit your mysql

<pre lang="mysql">$mysql>quit</pre>
