The following command will optimize all of your databases' tables within MySQL.
It is important to optimize tables to reduce data fragmentation.
<pre lang="bash">mysqlcheck -Aop -uroot</pre>
If you are not using *root* replace it with your username.



p. *-A* : Check all tables in all databases. This is the same as using the --databases option and naming all the databases on the command line.

*-o* : optimize the tables.

*-p* : Prompts for a password to use when connecting to the MySQL server.

*-u* : The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
