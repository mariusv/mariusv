Configuring your server so that when someone logs in with root or su, your server will notify you via email.

Please use an email address that is *NOT* hosted on your server as a hacker could merely delete the emails right off the server.

Login to your server with root

Use any editor to edit .bash_profile

At the end of the file, place the following lines:



<pre>echo ‘WARNING – Root Login detected on:’ `date` `who` | mail -s “WARNING -
Root Login: `who | awk ‘{print $6}’`” youremail@domain.com</pre>



Now anytime someone gains root access you will be notified via email.
