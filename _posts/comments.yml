  Hello. Nice article. A little improvement i suggest : 
  instead of 
  # established connections
  NETSTAT=`netstat -na |grep -i esta |grep -v 127.0.0.1 |sort -n -t. -k2` 
  i'd go for 
  NETSTAT=`netstat -pna |grep -i esta |grep -v 127.0.0.1 |sort -n -t. -k2` 
  
  Have a nice day

  How nice document.. the CONNMARK is new to me and to be able to save and restore the marks is what I'm looking for !! thanks...
  
  By the way, your quotes are shown wrong in my browsers (IE - on windows and Firefox, Konqueror on Linux). There seems to be a character encoding issue, you might want to look into that.. the quotes (like in "we've" show as three characters now.
  
  Cheers.

  hi marius,
  
  hope you could help me out here. i'm having problem with my wordpress site because my hosting says it creates zombie processes and it gets suspended every week or so. for the life of me, i can't seem to figure out what plugin has been causing it. i didn't add anything new. 
  
  well anyway, do you think this script you did is applicable to my wordpress site? i'm not sure if im allowed to add anything to the bin directory since it's a shared hosting plan. have to check later when i get home. but can you teach me how to run a cron job for this script? i saw a cron icon in my cpanel.
  
  hope you could help man. thanks!

--- !ruby/object:Comment 
author_email: lars.bailey@gmail.com

author_url: ""
content: |-
  IPv6 networking for OpenVZ containers,is no more difficult to setup,than configuring IPv4.
  I use IPv6 exclusively,using a combination of  RedHat and Debian containers.
  (non-bridged and bridged virtual Ethernet)
  The use of Proxy_NDP,is not a requirement,although it is often demonstrated in OVZ documentation.
  It has the same effect,as using ProxyARP for IPv4.
  This means,all containers are reachable from within a container.
  You can use the IP command,to add neighbors manually,if you need to.
  As long as you have traffic flow coming from a container,you can use;
  
  ip -6 neigh show
  
  on the Node,and all neighboring IPv6 containers are visible.
  As far as VENET,I do not used it.
  I find it limiting,in the types of applications that can be ran in a container.
  In short,if you want RedHat containers to have IPv6 networking,follow the same IPv6 rules as a physical machine.
  For Debian,the same rules apply,sans "modprobe ipv6".(this is not needed)
  As a side note,OVZ docs do have a "lacking" feature to them.
