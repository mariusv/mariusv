This image makes me think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w55Nib4uf1U&feature=related#t=1m36s">of the video clip of Takin’ Back My Love</a> by Enrique Iglesias and Ciara. I fail to see the logic behind the different attacks : she drops his paintings and clothes into the swimming pool, while he barely spills the milk on the floor. WTF ?
